# monomyth

this is my 100 days of code challenge except it's focused on learning systems design

projects here will be very stripped down so i can focus on their core concepts and make them approachable enough for me to be able to implement within a day or two

i have quadripartite goals

- learn basic system design and backend dev concepts
- how to narrow down scope of large projects
- get better familiarity with python, although I will likely use other languages here as well
- get better at implementation/churning projects from the ground up

time to go from peasant to a king ðŸ‘‘
